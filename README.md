# Hello. I'm ShichiNoBushi, and I like making games.

For all my life, I have liked games of all varieties including digital and analog (board, card, TTRPG). I started learning computer science with the intent of creating my own games and went to The University of Texas at Dallas to study and got a degree in Arts and Technology (ATEC) focusing on game development. I have also continued learning through boot.dev and been introduced to other languages and practices in software engineering. I like designing games, and many tend to go a bit outside the box exploring novel concepts. Below is a list of some of my projects.

* [Wild Space RPG](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ghgfYaQrrJxNv02-S3PG78V8ymhDLAjK4x_1gQrGVM/edit?usp=share_link) - a sci-fi/fantasy table-top role-playing game that uses playing cards
* War Buddies - a cooperative, asymetric top-down shooter where one player controls a plane and the other a tank with mechanics for elements on different layers
* Nyctophobia - a mouse-based platformer where the player controls a glowing fairy to guide a boy through a dark world
* Iron && Violet - a visual novel following the story of a family consisting of a human man, a gynoid, and an adopted child

I'm familiar with a number of programming languages and engines including the following. I am also intuitive and can quickly learn new languages and systems if I need to.

* Java
* C++
* Python
* Golang
* SQL
* Gamemaker
