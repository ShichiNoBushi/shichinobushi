# Hello. I'm ShichiNoBushi, and I like making games.

For all my life, I have liked games of all varieties including digital and analog (board, card, TTRPG). I started learning computer science with the intent of creating my own games and went to The University of Texas at Dallas to study and got a degree in Arts and Technology (ATEC) focusing on game development. I have also continued learning through boot.dev and been introduced to other languages and practices in software engineering. I like designing games, and many tend to go a bit outside the box exploring novel concepts. Below is a list of some of my projects.

* [To Do List](https://github.com/ShichiNoBushi/to_do_list) - a practice project in Python that lets the user create a list of tasks to do, mark any finished, and print lists filtered by if they are yet to be completed or not or if their target times are soon or overdue
* [In Situ](https://github.com/ShichiNoBushi/in_situ) - a resource collection and automation game where the player cotrols a robot and manages a colony on an alien world
* [Wild Space RPG](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ghgfYaQrrJxNv02-S3PG78V8ymhDLAjK4x_1gQrGVM/edit?usp=share_link) - a sci-fi/fantasy table-top role-playing game that uses playing cards
* [War Buddies](https://github.com/ShichiNoBushi/War-Buddies) - a cooperative, asymetric top-down shooter where one player controls a plane and the other a tank with mechanics for elements on different layers; developed in GameMaker
* Nyctophobia - a mouse-based platformer where the player controls a glowing fairy to guide a boy through a dark world
* Iron && Violet - a visual novel following the story of a family consisting of a human man, a gynoid, and an adopted child

I'm familiar with a number of programming languages and engines including the following. I am also intuitive and can quickly learn new languages and systems if I need to and have access to reference material.

* Java
* C++
* Python
* Golang
* SQL
* Gamemaker
